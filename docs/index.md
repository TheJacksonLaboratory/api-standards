    <em>Fostering Collaboration & Interoperability In Genomic Data Science</em>
</p>

APIs implementation plays a critical role in creation of scientific software, and thus 
scientific discovery. These documents propose a set of standards to both ease use of 
scientific software APIs, and ease their creation. By adhering to these standards, we 
aim to enhance the interoperability of our systems, improve the quality and 
reproducibility of scientific research, and foster an environment of open collaboration
among researchers in the genomics and genetics community.

-   :material-clock-fast:{ .lg .middle } __Easy To Use__

    ---

    Simple and approachable standards to help make software engineering faster, not 
    slower.
    
    Use your brainspace to work through scientific problems instead of architectural 
    ones.


-   :material-lightbulb-on:{ .lg .middle } __Defaults, Not Mandates__

    ---

    Each problem is different, and the needs a project should always take precedence
    over strict adherence to a standard.

-   :octicons-iterations-16:{ .lg .middle } __Fully Versioned__

    ---

    Standards are released with semantic versioning and preserved for future reference.

    !!! warning "Currently In Pre-release"
        We're still working on finalizing the first version of these standards.

        We don't expect any major changes, but we won't be preserving versions until
        we release the first version.


-   :material-web:{ .lg .middle } __Based On Existing Work__

    ---

    These standards collect the hard work of others, so you don't have to.

    Check out the awesome people we draw influence from:

-   :material-run-fast:{ .lg .middle } __Made For The Real World__

    ---

    Created by the API Standards Group at The Jackson Laboratory, 
    an open working group that is focused on creating standards for the development of APIs.

    The goals of this group are to create a set of standards that will allow for the 
    creation of APIs that are consistent, easy to use, easy to maintain, and which meet the 
    goals and priorities needed for user-interface development.
